            <p>
              I was a high school teacher for six years before becoming a
              front-end developer. Although there were aspects of teaching that
              I always enjoyed, I knew that it wasn't something that I could do
              all of my life. When I first set out to learn to code, I was
              overwhelmed at the task of having to teach myself correctly and
              hold myself accountable. I was relieved when I discovered
              SheCodes, because not only did SheCodes teach the material to me
              in digestible chunks and assign homework to check for
              understanding, but it linked me to a community of thousands of
              other women in the same boat as me. I feel as though SheCodes
              enabled me to follow through with my goal to change career paths,
              and created projects that now allow me to showcase my abilities
              and all that I've learned.
